### Hello!

<p>Welcome to my Github. My name is Maleeha Imran, and I'm a software engineer and graduate student at Georgia Tech. I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science from the University of California, Irvine, which provided me with a solid foundation in subjects including software development, computer networks, operating systems, computer architecture, and algorithms. For the past few years, my area of focus has been in artificial intellgience and machine learning. I've completed projects concerning ML model development and tuning, NLP, data processing and analysis, as well as web development.</p>

<p>Currently, alongside grad school coursework, I'm enrolled in the Meta Back-End Developer program. I've used this opportunity to gain skills in Django and REST APIs.</p>

<p>I do my best to stay up to date with emerging technologies like Generative AI and LLMs.</p>

<p>Feel free to check out some of the projects I have completed.</p>
